| `ordinal` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | The order in which this item variation should be displayed. This value is read-only. On writes, the ordinal<br>for each item variation within a parent `CatalogItem` is set according to the item variations's<br>position.

| `pricingType` | [`string \| undefined`](/doc/models/catalog-pricing-type.md) | Optional | Indicates whether the price of a CatalogItemVariation should be entered manually at the time of sale. |
| `priceMoney` | [`Money \| undefined`](/doc/models/money.md) | Optional | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See<br>[Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)<br>for more information. |

| `trackInventory` | `boolean \| undefined` | Optional | If `true`, inventory tracking is active for the variation. |
| `inventoryAlertType` | [`string \| undefined`](/doc/models/inventory-alert-type.md) | Optional | Indicates whether Square should alert the merchant when the inventory quantity of a CatalogItemVariation is low. |
| `inventoryAlertThreshold` | `bigint \| undefined` | Optional | If the inventory quantity for the variation is less than or equal to this value and `inventory_alert_type`<br>is `LOW_QUANTITY`, the variation displays an alert in the merchant dashboard.<br><br>This value is always an integer. |
| `userData` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | Arbitrary user metadata to associate with the item variation. This attribute value length is of Unicode code points.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `255` |
| `serviceDuration` | `bigint \| undefined` | Optional | If the `CatalogItem` that owns this item variation is of type<br>`APPOINTMENTS_SERVICE`, then this is the duration of the service in milliseconds. For<br>example, a 30 minute appointment would have the value `1800000`, which is equal to<br>30 (minutes) * 60 (seconds per minute) * 1000 (milliseconds per second). |
