# Invoice Payment Request

Represents a payment request for an [invoice](/doc/models/invoice.md). Invoices can specify a maximum
of 13 payment requests, with up to 12 `INSTALLMENT` request types. For more information,
see [Payment requests](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/invoices-api/overview#payment-requests).

Adding `INSTALLMENT` payment requests to an invoice requires an
[Invoices Plus subscription](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/invoices-api/overview#invoices-plus-subscription).

This field<br>is required to create a payment request.<br><br>After this date, the invoice becomes overdue. For example, a payment `due_date` of 2021-03-09 with a `timezone`<br>of America/Los\_Angeles becomes overdue at midnight on March 9 in America/Los\_Angeles (which equals a UTC<br>timestamp of 2021-03-10T08:00:00Z). |

The sum of the `percentage_requested` in all installment<br>  payment requests must be equal to 100.<br><br>You cannot specify this when the payment `request_type` is `BALANCE` or when the<br>payment request specifies the `fixed_amount_requested_money` field. |
| `tippingEnabled` | `boolean \| undefined` | Optional | If set to true, the Square-hosted invoice page (the `public_url` field of the invoice)<br>provides a place for the customer to pay a tip.<br><br>This field is allowed only on the final payment request  <br>and the payment `request_type` must be `BALANCE` or `INSTALLMENT`. |
