# Search Team Members Filter

Represents a filter used in a search for `TeamMember` objects. `AND` logic is applied
between the individual fields, and `OR` logic is applied within list-based fields.
For example, setting this filter value:

```
filter = (locations_ids = ["A", "B"], status = ACTIVE)
```

returns only active team members assigned to either location "A" or "B".
