`V1Order`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `errors` | [`Error[] \| undefined`](/doc/models/error.md) | Optional | Any errors that occurred during the request. |
| `id` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | The order's unique identifier. |
| `buyerEmail` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | The email address of the order's buyer. |
| `recipientName` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | The name of the order's buyer. |
| `recipientPhoneNumber` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | The phone number to use for the order's delivery. |
| `state` | [`string \| undefined`](/doc/models/v1-order-state.md) | Optional | - |
| `shippingAddress` | [`Address \| undefined`](/doc/models/address.md) | Optional | Represents a postal address in a country. The address format is based<br>on an [open-source library from Google](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput). For more information,<br>see [AddressValidationMetadata](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput/wiki/AddressValidationMetadata).<br>This format has dedicated fields for four address components: postal code,<br>locality (city), administrative district (state, prefecture, or province), and<br>sublocality (town or village). These components have dedicated fields in the<br>`Address` object because software sometimes behaves differently based on them.<br>For example, sales tax software may charge different amounts of sales tax<br>based on the postal code, and some software is only available in<br>certain states due to compliance reasons.<br><br>For the remaining address components, the `Address` type provides the<br>`address_line_1` and `address_line_2` fields for free-form data entry.<br>These fields are free-form because the remaining address components have<br>too many variations around the world and typical software does not parse<br>these components. These fields enable users to enter anything they want.<br><br>Note that, in the current implementation, all other `Address` type fields are blank.<br>These include `address_line_3`, `sublocality_2`, `sublocality_3`,<br>`administrative_district_level_2`, `administrative_district_level_3`,<br>`first_name`, `last_name`, and `organization`.<br><br>When it comes to localization, the seller's language preferences<br>(see [Language preferences](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api#location-specific-and-seller-level-language-preferences))<br>are ignored for addresses. Even though Square products (such as Square Point of Sale<br>and the Seller Dashboard) mostly use a seller's language preference in<br>communication, when it comes to addresses, they will use English for a US address,<br>Japanese for an address in Japan, and so on. |
| `subtotalMoney` | [`V1Money \| undefined`](/doc/models/v1-money.md) | Optional | - |
| `totalShippingMoney` | [`V1Money \| undefined`](/doc/models/v1-money.md) | Optional | - |
| `totalTaxMoney` | [`V1Money \| undefined`](/doc/models/v1-money.md) | Optional | - |
| `totalPriceMoney` | [`V1Money \| undefined`](/doc/models/v1-money.md) | Optional | - |
| `totalDiscountMoney` | [`V1Money \| undefined`](/doc/models/v1-money.md) | Optional | - |
| `createdAt` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | The time when the order was created, in ISO 8601 format. |
| `updatedAt` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | The time when the order was last modified, in ISO 8601 format. |
| `expiresAt` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | The time when the order expires if no action is taken, in ISO 8601 format. |
| `paymentId` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | The unique identifier of the payment associated with the order. |
| `buyerNote` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | A note provided by the buyer when the order was created, if any. |
| `completedNote` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | A note provided by the merchant when the order's state was set to COMPLETED, if any |

| `canceledNote` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | A note provided by the merchant when the order's state was set to CANCELED, if any. |
| `tender` | [`V1Tender \| undefined`](/doc/models/v1-tender.md) | Optional | A tender represents a discrete monetary exchange. Square represents this<br>exchange as a money object with a specific currency and amount, where the<br>amount is given in the smallest denomination of the given currency.<br><br>Square POS can accept more than one form of tender for a single payment (such<br>as by splitting a bill between a credit card and a gift card). The `tender`<br>field of the Payment object lists all forms of tender used for the payment.<br><br>Split tender payments behave slightly differently from single tender payments:<br><br>The receipt_url for a split tender corresponds only to the first tender listed<br>in the tender field. To get the receipt URLs for the remaining tenders, use<br>the receipt_url fields of the corresponding Tender objects.<br><br>*A note on gift cards**: when a customer purchases a Square gift card from a<br>merchant, the merchant receives the full amount of the gift card in the<br>associated payment.<br><br>When that gift card is used as a tender, the balance of the gift card is<br>reduced and the merchant receives no funds. A `Tender` object with a type of<br>`SQUARE_GIFT_CARD` indicates a gift card was used for some or all of the<br>associated payment. |
| `orderHistory` | [`V1OrderHistoryEntry[] \| undefined`](/doc/models/v1-order-history-entry.md) | Optional | The history of actions associated with the order. |
| `promoCode` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | The promo code provided by the buyer, if any. |
| `btcReceiveAddress` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | For Bitcoin transactions, the address that the buyer sent Bitcoin to. |
| `btcPriceSatoshi` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | For Bitcoin transactions, the price of the buyer's order in satoshi (100 million satoshi equals 1 BTC). |
